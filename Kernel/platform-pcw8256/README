An UZI target for the Amstrad PCW series computers

16K banked memory with flexible bank setting. Programs for now (until brk()
is done right) get 64K in four consecutive page numbers. The UAREA is mapped
high at 0xF900 with the process and irq stacks following and a copy of the
common area beyond (so we have a sort of common code area as needed)

The very top of memory must be free as the top of bank 3 (top of OS kernel
mapping) is "magically" the keyboard mappings.

Need to try and keep kernel under 48K or so to make it easier to handle the
screen memory, fonts etc. We need to put the screen (720x256 pixels + roller
ram table of 512 bytes or so = ~ 24K) in the low 128K


Building A Boot Image
---------------------

edit Makefile and set it to z80, platform pcw8256
make clean; make
cd platform-pcw8256/BOOTBLOCK
zmac 765.s


# Make a blank disc
dd if=/dev/zero of=bootdisk.raw bs=512 count=360
# Add the boot block in sector 0
dd if=platform-pcw8256/BOOBLOCK/765.cim of=bootdisk.raw conv=notrunc
# Add the kernel
dd if=fuzix.bin of=bootdisk.raw bs=512 seek=1 conv=notrunc

# Start the emulator
xjoyce

Hit F3 (Boot from alternative disc)
Boot From
	=>Other
Enter filename for disc image
	Disc file...
		select bootdisk.raw
	Advanced
		Raw disc image file
	OK
	OK

Should boot and detect the drives then prompt bootdev:

At that point the keyboard should work.

The floppy driver is incomplete but given a rootfs image on /dev/fd1 you
should be able to at least get it to mount

device 0 = fd0 1 = fd1


Mixed boot/root images are not currently supported (this just needs a modified
boot block that starts at a different offset)
